# Your cat just had kittens! Now you want to put up an ad to give them
# to your friends. You'll need to save all names of the kittens,
# confirm that they each of them is cute, and show a message that
# that kitten is ready for adoption.
# Break this task up into a couple of steps of pseudocode
# and write the pseudocode below in code comments.
# You don't need to write any functional code, just map out the steps.

#1. SET list_kittens = {"name1", "name2", "name3", "nameN"}
#2. FOT each kitten IN the list_kittens
    #3. IF kitten = cute:
        #4. print("kitten is ready for adoption!!")
